Identity configuration
======================

The identity configuration defines the users, groups, administrators and roles created as part of the SFTPPlus application.

For these users and administrators the full life-cycle is managed by SFTPPlus.

SFTPPlus also allows authentication of external users or administrators.
This is done via the :doc:`Authentication methods </configuration-auth/index>`.
