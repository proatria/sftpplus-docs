Local File System Location
==========================

A `local file system location` is accessed using the operating system's
file system.

For now, no extra configuration options are available for this location type.

..  note::
    For the moment, local file system locations can't be defined from the
    Local Manager GUI.
    There is a single default local filesystem which is
    available inside the GUI and which can not be removed.
