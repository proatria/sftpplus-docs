        cwa_14051
        iso_8601
        iso_8601_local

            port
            protocol
            family
    component:

        uuid
        type
    server:

Many events have `data.path` and `data.real_path`, together with the
associated `data.file_name`, `data.directory_name`, `data.real_file_name`, and
`data.real_directory_name`.
